# Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, which uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique aims to improve productivity and focus by encouraging regular breaks.
